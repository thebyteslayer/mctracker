# mcTracker

This plugin lets you track any player with a compass named after them. If the target is in a different dimension, the compass points to their last known portal location.

This is made possible with Minecraft's Lodestone mechanic.

> [!NOTE]
> On request I will upgrade or downgrade the plugin to any version if possible.
